# Welcome to Habits App!

Here I'll make an end-to-end application with Prisma, Fastify, React-Native, Expo, ReactJS, NodeJS and some other tools, following the [Rocketseat](https://github.com/Rocketseat) nlw (Next Level Week) tutorial.

- In day one, we made the project setup installing a lot of tools and dependecies and we let the enviroment ready to begin the app development, properly speaking.

- On day two, we created the tables (or model, according to Prisma) and their respective relationships with the http get and post methods to create a habit, or visualize all the habits until a certain day.

  In the frontend we created the header and the table that receives several small squares that symbolize the days.

  On mobile we create several components, packages to style them and configuration files for these dependencies to work

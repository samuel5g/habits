# Welcome to Habits App!

Here I'll make an end-to-end application with Prisma, Fastify, React-Native, Expo, ReactJS, NodeJS and some other tools, following the [Rocketseat](https://github.com/Rocketseat) nlw (Next Level Week) tutorial.

- In day one, we made the project setup installing a lot of tools and dependecies and we let the enviroment ready to begin the app development, properly speaking.
